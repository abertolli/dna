The idea of this program is to see if random evolution can occur.

This program will
(1) Make a copy of itself
(2) Change some bytes at random
(3) Run the copy and wait for it to finish executing
(4) Delete the program
(5) Go back to number 1

To simulate an environment with limited resources, it would
be ideal to run this program as a user with a quota limitation.
